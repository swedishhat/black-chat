===================

RF transceiver project for UF ECE Design II
By Russell Crowe & Patrick Lloyd

###Premise:
There are still many areas without modern GSM or internet infrastructure but where communication is still vital. Existing technology is either prohibitively expensive or too inconvenient to implement. The goal of this project is to create an ad-hoc GSM network that can transmit SMS messages from any GSM phone through a long range AM transceiver. It can be used as a point-to-point darknet or as a free public use communication terminal through the use of OpenBTS's VoIP infrastructure. 

###TODO:
1) Primary research
  * Legality of Ham radio broadcasting
  * Meet with Hams & radio engineers like Zmuda & Taylor about concept
  * OpenBTS implemetation feasibility on different hardware platforms
  * Look into encoding GSM / Ham-band data (protocols)
  * What hardware currently exists for doing something similar
 
2) High level system design
  * What primary hardware and software blocks need to be implemented?
  * Frequencies to design for
    * Antennas
	  * ADC/DAC requirements
  	  * FPGA speed
  * Cost estimate
  * RF PCB design considerations
 
3) Hardware design
