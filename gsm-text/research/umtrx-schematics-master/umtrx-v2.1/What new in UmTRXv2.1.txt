Whats new in UmTRXv2.1

1. C167 Removed and DC supply connector PJ-002AH-SMT now placed there for lab users.
2. Fixed unrouted GND track under the fpga, which wasn't issue because of redundant. 
3. Both FAN1 and FAN2 now can be supplied from +6V or +8..28V through R172/R172' or R171/R171'.
4. PVDDSPI33 of LMS's connected to +2.5VLMS (L13) because of SPI port is 2.5VCMOS at FPGA side.
5. OHM4 component footprint fixed to place it from top side (issue 32).
6. LMS output matching capasitor C96'= 3pF added (issue 41).
7. DC/DC syncro problem fixed. C23 = 100pF added to sync circuit of DC/DC converters (issue 42).
8. Thermosensors added for both LMS. Both connected to EEPROM I2C bus.
9. For better performance, +3.3VLMS supplied from DC/DC+3.3V via inductor filter instead of noisy U29. 
10. Fixed netlabels of pins AA1 and AB4 of FPGA and S1 signed "RESET", but S2 signed "SAFE" (issue 40).
11. Returned MCX connectors for all RF signals, but U.FL connectors still can be used at the same places.
12. GPS, CLK and PPS now with onboard through hole SMA connectors at the edge of board.
